# verilog-problem_solving-chipdev
My Verilog solutions to practice problems from chipdev.io.

This repository is where I practice Verilog coding to strengthen my fundamentals for core VLSI interviews. I’m using chipdev.io problems to sharpen my skills in:

Core Verilog concepts – combinational and sequential logic

Writing clean, reusable modules with proper testbenches

Building a strong HDL coding habit for FPGA and ASIC design work

Each folder includes:

A Verilog module I wrote to solve the problem

A testbench (when needed) to simulate and verify correctness

Sometimes notes on how I approached the solution

Goal: Improve my Verilog coding skills and build a solid foundation for VLSI, FPGA, and ASIC design interviews.2@
